# PokemonTypeCalculator
This program is designed to aid in the analysis of Pokemon types and is fully compatable with custom types.

## Custom types
To add custom types, you can edit src/main/resources/types.txt with a text editor  
Formatting is as follows:

- TypeName
- Weakness Are Separated With Spaces
- Resistances Are Also
- Immunities Are Important Too

## Custom weights
There is currently no way to edit the weights in which resistances, weaknesses, and immunities are scaled in the rank1 command without editing the source code  
This functionality will be added in a future version

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbabuschak/PokemonTypeCalculator.git
```
## Running the program
